      <h1>Meine Liebe Dorota,</h1>
      <p>I have been wanting to write to you for a while now, starting to scribble a few sentences and then starting all over again out of frustration at not being able to find the right words.
There are things that can't really be expressed; words are barely enough and, although expressions sometimes complement them, they are necessarily alienated by the cognitive translation they undergo. Like an interpreter who must sometimes sacrifice the literal translation in order to preserve the larger meaning of the sentence he or she is translating, our brain necessarily distorts the feeling it wishes to express; it risks otherwise omitting the context, dulling the color of the feeling.
</p>

      <p>I will then allow myself to do here what my profession forbids me to do; I will not dwell on the tedious task of conceptualizing or ensuring the exact translation of my feelings. I will simply describe my experience, without smoothing the description so that it corresponds perfectly to the explanation. And if by any chance I were to try to understand - it is the nature of the mind to want to grasp everything, even wrongly -, I would grant myself the right to be imprecise, to let the spontaneous, uncertain explanation spring forth, in favor of deferred reflection. I don't pretend to assume such an approach - and I hold as proof this paragraph, which only serves to justify myself -, but I believe I am legitimate to allow myself this without too many scruples.</p>
      
      <p>Dorota, first of all, I'm sorry. <br>
I'm sorry I disappeared, I'm sorry I played dead. I think for a moment I really thought I was dead. I relapsed at the beginning of this winter in my negative thoughts, my heavy and muddy ruminations like quicksand. I had been warned that when you give yourself, you never fully recover. When you expose yourself, you lose feathers. But by taking the feather, we bare ourselves. And it is naked, that I wish to put myself for you. </p>
     
      <blockquote>Ut id nisl sit amet elit hendrerit bibendum. Nullam ut nisl ac metus varius pellentesque. Maecenas eu lorem lectus. Etiam iaculis semper facilisis. Vivamus ut magna vitae ipsum accumsan dictum. Nulla euismod eget mauris vel hendrerit. Suspendisse potenti. Nunc eu tortor sem. Vivamus fermentum mauris eget tristique pulvinar. Sed eget ipsum ac massa aliquam egestas vel vitae purus.</blockquote>
<p>
  Then, I hope you are well. I understand that my disappearance can be understood as a lack of interest, as if I no longer cared about you. But it's rather the opposite: I was so obsessed with you that the prospect of a future project as big as the one that is happening to me immediately became incompatible with my obsession. So I cut it off. But I still think about you. I hope so much that you are well. I hope your life is going well, that your studies are fulfilling you, that you continue to exchange a beautiful animal relationship with Max, that you have decided to get a kitten, that you finally dare to love, that your love is fulfilled, that your thoughts are sweet and relieving.
      </p>
      <p>If you wonder, I'm fine. I'm doing much better since the beginning of the year. I think the disconnect from media, social media and reconnecting with my body and nature is doing me a lot of good. It's a cliché, isn't it? Whatever! I needed to disconnect and reconnect with something more ancestral, more authentic.
      </p>
      
      <p>Ah, Dorota!<br>
I don't want to forget you, or you to forget me. I just can't forget you. I would have preferred that my need to cut was done more gently than by cutting sharply and drastically, but I don't think I had the means at that time.
      </p>
      
      <p>The memories of our first discussions often come back to my mind. There was something familiar in your words, which I perceived then as if they had been your eyes. With the hindsight that I could not have at that moment, I can only reason to believe that it must have been your deep sadness, although more on the surface than I heard, and that I recognized the strange sweetness that often accompanies it; there is nothing more docile than a sad look, and thus, nothing more simply human. This is what touched me, I think: you were human. And the more you tried to be less human, the more you became human in my eyes.
      </p>
      
      <p>Very quickly, I unintentionally fell into the attraction of the magnificent enigma that you were. At the same time mysterious, and yet so understandable, so coherent. Much more coherent than the rest of the world. I never knew how much my emotions were prey to your attention towards me. They, the feelings, decided and not the reason. I knew for a fact that you sometimes pulled away to protect yourself from your growing feelings for me; then sometimes you dared, you moved on. This explanation would have been enough to relieve me, and yet there was nothing I could do: I was prey. On your side, I believe that you had the sweetness to love me and the wisdom to hate me. But maybe I am wrong... as I often am.
      </p>
      
      <p>I must admit, in thirty years, I have hardly met many people who have been able to reassure me by their mere presence, by their personality and their natural propensity to act in a way that corresponds to my most hidden needs - those that I myself am only now barely able to distinguish, far from understanding.
      </p>
      
      <p>I wonder how it was possible that a person of your age, much more innocent in reality than the image that you sometimes try to send back, knew how to answer with so much subtlety and accuracy to these needs. Your very person seemed to be the ideal content for the container of my soul, the natural antidote to my most archaic fears.<br>
I have refrained from attributing any intentionality to you: I remain convinced that you have never acted otherwise than simply being yourself, in your purest candor, without trying to find the most adequate answer and behavior to my situation of the moment. But this lack of intention only added to your importance in my eyes. I felt as if you naturally and unconditionally completed me. How I loved you!<br>
I named your candor; I feel I must point out that with all the intelligence you undoubtedly have, you cannot be totally innocent. Far from being naïve, you nevertheless preserve your freshness of soul which manifests itself in you like a refuge in the storm of disillusionments that life has been up to now. You have the unfathomable liveliness of souls who know sadness and your sarcasm leaves no doubt that you have suffered; and at the same time, one perceives in you this capacity, voluntary, to let yourself be fooled, as if life - and ill-intentioned people - would find enough ballast for you to be at risk of abusing it.
      </p>
      
      <p>Ah, in my exchanges with you, and as it is not rare, under your mask of arrogance and coldness stood naked the greatest sensitivity. A particular sensitivity; cold but powerful, detached but enveloping; inconsolable, like mine. How I loved you!
      </p>
      
      <p>I will no longer mope in sadness. It makes me think, makes me anticipate potential losses and put them into perspective. But it blows air and broods. It follows boredom and precedes anxiety and despair. I knew there was a risk of getting hurt, but I clearly underestimated the extent of it. But now I've grown out of it.
      </p>
      
      <p>I soon realized that you meant a lot to me, but that you were unable, or unwilling, to give me what I wanted on an ongoing basis. And deep down, I am looking for stability as much as I am looking for understanding and affection. Then in the end, the instability and impermanence of your emotional presence also gave me a sense of the conditionality of your affection. That was your goal: to get me away from you.<br> 
I understand today that this goal was benevolent, that it was necessary. I thank you for having had the wisdom of mind that I may have always lacked.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can blame me for not being able to fight more, for not being able to reconcile my detachment in love with the detachment of our friendship. I accept this reproach. I'm sorry I left you alone in that terrifying world.
      </p>
      
      <p>You are a beautiful and great person, Dorota. <br>
I loved you so sincerely, that I will always keep you in my heart, somewhere. I hope that life will spare you from its cruelty. Please, love! Love as you have not yet known how to love and do not stop. Don't be afraid, the world is full of good people who fit your needs.
      </p>
      
      <p>I know you will be happy, I know you will love deeply and passionately, I know you will find something that fits your needs. I know that you will be fulfilled - maybe you already are.<br>
And when you are comforted (we always comfort each other) you will be glad you knew me. You will always be my friend.<br>
You will always leave an indelible mark on my memory and on my life. I really wish we could be friends, even if I don't know how to do that.<br>
<br>
Thank you for everything, Dorota.<br>
I try to be there again, but in my own way. More subtly. At the pace that now seems right.<br>
I care about you.<br>
<br>
Tenderly,<br><br>
        Ales
